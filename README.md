Talmudy: A Search Engine for the Talmud

Background:
Talmudy is a search engine for the Talmud. 
We like to playfully think of it as a “Google for the Talmud.” 
The Talmud is an expansive work, spanning complete Jewish law and customs. 
Even though it is an ancient text, it is central to Jewish religious life today 
and is studied around the globe. 
Its readership runs the spectrum from ultra-observant Jews to Christians in South Korea.

Issue:
As we see it, the problem with the Talmud is the “searchability factor.” 
Containing 63 tractates, it is larger than the Encyclopedia Britannica. 
However, unlike encyclopedias, it has no index. 
There are no headings or page numbers or differentiation 
of subjects as we would recognize them today. 
For such a widely used text, 
it is nearly impossible to search from topic to topic and personality to personality, 
even for scholars who have been studying for years. 
It is undebatable that the Talmud is a genius piece of holy work, 
but it is also highly confusing because of the lack of sequence between arguments 
and because of topics that run into each other with no obvious beginning or end. 
The fact that the major studiers of the Talmud are often behind the curve 
with current technologies has not helped in indexing the ancient holy text.

Solution:
In today’s world, we have grown accustomed to instantaneous access 
to information that requires little brain power whatsoever. 
Talmudy is an app, as well as a website, compatible with smartphones, tablets, and computers. 
It bridges the gap between the ancient and the modern 
by indexing and categorizing the entire Talmud. 
Similar to a search engine, the main page has a search bar where any topic 
or personality related to the Talmud or Torah can be simply plugged in. 
The program will filter through the thousands of results to display the top hits. 
Beyond this, the results will provide the user with 
the exact tractates and locations of their search, 
as well as the amount of times the search query exists in the Talmud. 
To make the program even more useful to the user, 
it will also provide the English translation of the source 
around where the search query is found. 
The results are clear and easy for the user to understand and view. 
When the source includes arguments between Talmudic personalities, 
which occurs often within the Talmud, 
the English translation of the source will be displayed 
in a very straightforward question-answer format. 
There will also be links if the source directly connects 
to another source and the program can jump the user to the related source. 
Other features include drop down menus of popular categories and search queries, 
drop down menus of each tractate if the user wants to view it as a whole, 
sources of quotes from the Old Testament, 
and simple graphics for younger users and students. 
In the future, as Talmudy expands, it will include 
graphic cards about Talmudic personalities, information regarding them, 
and links to where else they appear in the Talmud.

The genius behind Talmudy is its simplicity. 
Yes, few other publications have tried to sort out the Talmud 
but their apps, books, or programs are meant for scholars 
or people who have time to sit in a synagogue or learn for extended periods. 
As well, some other applications have tried 
but none have reached online success. 
Talmudy's appearance is minimal and not complicated like other programs on the market. 
The screen and design is uncluttered and only provides 
the relevant information in an easy-to-view experience.

We anticipate Talmudy becoming a success because of its aforementioned simplicity. 
Talmudy is meant for those needing quick access to the Talmud and its specific sources. 
It is meant for those who are short on time 
and do not have the luxury of pulling out books from a large library. 
It is meant for those who work long hours 
and need to quickly prepare for their one-hour study session in the evening. 
It is meant for teachers and lecturers who need to access a passage quickly before their 8:30 am class.

In our information-centric world, Talmudy is what every studier of the Talmud needs. 
With its streamlined, uncluttered look and replication of the tools other popular search engines use, 
it will be a success for all those demanding quick access to the Talmud. 
It will fill a void people did not know was possible.
